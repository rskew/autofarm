      "abstract": "These days, most people speaking APIs think REST API. It's ubiquitous, uses standard protocols and formats, based on giants shoulders...\r\nFor the sysadmin REST API like Redfish is a nice way to have a cross-manufacturer out of band management interface e.g.\r\n\r\nHowever in some case, you have constraints that do not allow you to use a REST API. When your system is not reachable directly using the HTTPS protocol e.g.  In that case, you can still use an API of course, but based on other standards, such as the venerable STMP one !\r\n\r\nOur use case, a training on demand workshop system, involves a Web front-end to manage user registration to run jupyter notebooks hosted on a back-end hosting the jupyterhub instance as well as all the companion systems needed to perform the various workshops proposed (on Redfish, Git, Rust as visible on https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops)\r\n\r\nSo to make it work flawlessly, we used an SMTP based API, the front-end generating the SMTP content and the back-end using procmail, some scripts and ansible playbooks to manage the setup of the user environment. Once logged on the platform, the user has acces to its own workshop content, with all the links to the other systems available to perform the actions. Why SMTP ? Well our needs were small enough to avoid developing a full REST one (even if if have also one for the front-end), we benefit from the asynchronous aspect of e-mail for free in the management of requests, and it's fun to use old methods to show young engineers that there is more than one way to do it ;-)\r\n\r\nInterested ? Well come to hear how we did that and we'll show you how it works, from the automatic deployment of the platform up to the run of a workshop.",

      "abstract": "The Digital Earth Australia and Digital Earth Africa programs host and process very large volumes of open data on cloud infrastructure using primarily Kubernetes as an orchestration mechanism. The project is run out of an Australian government agency, Geoscience Australia, and as such, this infrastructure needs to meet the [Essential-8](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/essential-eight/essential-eight-explained) security mitigation requirements.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents the difficult balancing act of meeting the security needs of an openaccess, open data and open source platform. The principal workloads on this infrastructure include web applications, petabyte scale data processing and cross-continent data movement. Part of this platform enables scientific experimentation, which essentially allows arbitrary code execution too. Recent statistical operations on year-long continental Satellite imagery time-series for Africa consumed 4,000 CPUs and 50 TiB of RAM across 200 nodes.\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure is mostly codified and open sourced [here](https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-k8s-eks) as terraform modules. Applications are deployed via [Helm Charts](https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-charts) and scanned using [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy). The network within the cluster and to the outside is filtered using [Cilium](https://cilium.io/). Deployments are automated and audit-logged via GitOps and [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux).\r\nThe ability for users to self-signup and run arbitrary code occasionally leads to some cycles being lost to Monero. This talk will cover general security principles as well as specific security incidents and mitigation actions taken in response.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, our stack meets Australian Government security practice, while enabling very large workloads to be executed in a flexible, on-demand computation environment that empowers scientific users. This talk will tell you how we do it.",

      "abstract": "When an open source project has gotten stuck, how do you get it unstuck? Especially if you aren't already one of its maintainers? My teams have done or are doing this with Mailman, PyPI, pipenv, and Autoconf, and I have some lessons to share. It is even possible for a new contributor, who's never worked on a project before, to show up and be the catalyst that revives a project or gets a long-delayed release out the door. I'll share a few case studies, principles, and gotchas.\r\n\r\nThere's also a larger context here; why do projects get stuck in the first place? Why do so many widely used, multi-contributor, reasonably important free and open source software projects find themselves years behind their intended release schedules, or caught between legacy maintenance burdens and the effort of a much-needed architectural overhaul, or stifled by simmering and unresolved interpersonal disagreements? I propose that a key factor here is the lack of prior management experience and skill among many FLOSS project maintainers. Individual contributors who have never managed public-facing projects before are often in dire need of project and product management skills -- and may not realize it. I'll discuss that problem, the particular set of skills maintainers often need and don't have, and various initiatives -- including my own upcoming book -- to teach those skills.\r\n\r\nMore than developer time, maintainership -- coordination, leadership, and management -- is a bottleneck in software sustainability. You'll come away from this talk with steps you can take, in the short term and in the long run, to address this for projects you care about.",

Can we move to using \"unsigned long\"? Or a struct? How will this impact 32 bit and 64 bit systems? What about little and big endian ones? Do we have to change anything at all?\r\nWe will see how the mailing list's form of dialectic helps answer these questions.",

But beyond this, a precise documentation and definition of subsystems is also necessary for upcoming challenges like certifications in safety critical environments (for instance, as aspired by the Linux Foundation's ELISA project). Proper documentation also eases general quality ensurance, provides help for longterm maintenance, and lowers the initial learning curve for newcomers. Therefore, we decided to take a look at the bigger picture. Quite literally, actually.\r\n\r\nOur talk discusses methods to visualise the entire repository subsystem topology using graphs based on data mining in the kernel. It measures intersections of responsibility for MAINTAINERS entries, and clusters them based on overlap intensity, effectively detecting de-facto subsystems. It reveals sensible, though sometimes surprising, structures, compares the differences between de-facto and documented subsystems, and shows numerous possibilities for using the data, ranging from improvements to the development process to formal safety-critical certification efforts.",

      "abstract": "I recently built a web application called the Open Journal Matcher (https://ojm.ocert.at), which is a recommender tool for academics looking to find a suitable scholarly journal for their work. The Open Journal Matcher allows users to paste in a draft abstract, which it then compares with the abstracts of over 5600 journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals. The application then returns the top five suggested matches, which are meant to be both relevant and serendipitous. This can be very useful to anyone trying to find an appropriate journal for their work.\r\n\r\nWhile there are other journal matching services available, to my knowledge this is the only one that is both fully interdisciplinary and fully open source. The code for the matcher application, the code for the matching algorithm, and the content of the journals, is all openly licensed. \r\n\r\nUpon its release in June 2020, the OJM received a very favorable reception from the open scholarship and scholarly communications communities. It has been shared widely by on many platforms. For me, this has reaffirmed the need for such a tool, and has led me to focus on its further development.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will describe insights gleaned while building this tool. I\u2019ll describe the challenges of gathering journal data from the Directory of Open Access Journals\u2019 API at scale; the numerous lessons learned while using natural language processing tools to calculate the similarity of texts; and the difficulties processing large amounts of data very quickly for the web using Google Cloud Platform and asynchronous Python programming.\r\n\r\nThis project also raises important questions about the ethics of algorithmic decision making. As technologists, how do we critically evaluate the algorithms that we use when we solve practical programming problems? How do we communicate the trade-offs and choices we make to stakeholders in our communities who rely upon the tools we build? And how do we ensure that feedback from our communities always comes first in shaping those tools, so that they most help the people we are serving?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will be of interest to authors who are looking for a journal to publish their scholarly work. It will also be relevant to technologists who are interested in building open source tools for their communities. It will be helpful to librarians who promote scholarly communications, and who may find this tool to be a useful addition to their toolkit. Lastly, it will serve as an interesting example of the novel services we can provide to our communities when we apply open digital technologies in support of our scholarship.",

      "abstract": "Space is cool, right? Of course it is! But ask any programmer you know how much they know about the technical implementations of how humans observe or operate in space? They'll likely be unable to tell you much. Because this is a domain entrenched in hardware and communications technologies we developers don't have to interact with often, if at all; to many, domain-specific hardware in a science like astronomy may as well be magic. But the same can be true for the other side; many of the highly technical personnel working in the space sciences--from astrophysicists to communications engineers--often know software practices only as far as it is required to construct scripts or maintain single libraries to run a pipeline whose parameters or requirements sometimes won't change for decades. Herein lies an interdisciplinary domain ripe for collaboration or specialisation.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a high-speed crash course in the some of the key data formats, units and terminology used in the domain of radio astronomy--particularly the kind of near-Earth observation that has become so critical to our mitigation of the ever-impending space debris crisis--for those from a software background. But there will be no circuit diagrams here; let's approach the topic with less maths and more drawings and mad gesturing, and to tell the great story of space observation that led us to this point and its impact on practices (particularly software practices) still in use today. \r\n\r\nFrom the technical and socio-political determinants of core components like units of measurement and the conflicting standards for their conversion, to the slightly incorrect application of open source paradigms and the prevalence of sole maintainers. From the original FORTRAN, QBASIC and C libraries that still underlie the majority of this domain, to the costs of opting for one of the modern Python alternatives. And with a special focus on the particularities of Australia's own radio telescopy capabilities and publicly available resources.\r\n\r\nIn this tale of off-by-one errors and spherical trigonometry there is fun and humour to be found, as well as tools and lessons you can use to start delving into hard space science problems from your own computer: such as tracking satellite passes, interpreting analog-first telescope imagery, measuring the efficacy of different space surveillance systems, and more! All you need is some Python (or your own favourite language)!",

As its use spreads among more and more kernel subsystems, the length and complexity of BPF programs are also increasing.  That, combined with the fact that the kernel BPF verifier is getting more and more smart, allowing more sophisticated programs to run in the kernel, results in people wanting to write BPF programs in high-level languages such as C. \r\n\r\nFor many years a LLVM port was the only option for BPF developers who wanted to write C BPF programs.  A year ago Oracle undertook the task to add a BPF port to the GNU Toolchain.  At the present time we have upstreamed support for BPF to GCC, the binutils (assembler, disassembler, linker)  the GDB debugger and the GNU simulator.  This is work in progress, and we are currently in the task of adding support for BTF and CO-RE (Compile once, run everywhere.)\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will describe the current status of the port and quickly show how it can be used to do BPF development.",

At the chip level Open ISAs allow new extensions and specialised compute functions to be added - something we are now seeing in production systems.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will give an update on the state of play of Open ISAs. With a new OpenPOWER and RISC-V announcements made in 2020 there is more to talk about, following on from the Open ISA miniconf at LCA2020. The relevance of OpenISAs to the broader Open source community/technical commons grows daily and with increasing consolidation of vendors in the closed CPU space, it is even more important that we focus on OpenISAs if we are to continue to enjoy viable libre computing alternatives.",

      "abstract": "Whenever a developer makes a change to a body of software (adds a feature, makes a bugfix), that developer wants to know (and even more important, the upstream maintainers want to know) whether and how it affects system performance.  Too often on the mailing lists I see the phrase 'The performance change is down in the noise'\r\n\r\nTwo simple statistical tests can be used to determine whether a change is *really* down in the noise, or  whether there's a real difference.  Student's T test can tell you how likely it is that the mean of two sample sets is the  same, but it works only on Normal (Gaussian) distributions.  The Mann-Whitney U test tells you how likely it is for the median to be the same, and works on *any* underlying distribution.\r\n\r\nKernel microbenchmarks usually show very  skewed distributions, where the minimum and the mode are the same;  but there is a long tail, with several small modal points in it.\r\nI've worked out the reason for this, and how to use the Mann-Whitney U test to determine whether small changes (too noisy to see by eyeballing the resutst) are real or not.\r\n\r\nEven though this talk has some statistics in it, I'm not a statistician, so it's all stuff that anyone with year 10 maths can understand.",

Human- and machine-readable data descriptions are included using RO-Crate, a format for managing linked data using the JSON-LD and Schema.org standards.\r\n\r\nDatasets stored in this format can be then indexed using open-source tools such as Solr or ElasticSearch and made available for search, discovery and download.\r\n\r\nArkisto is intended to address the issue of research data collections which are no longer being looked after, due to institutional changes, lack of funding or software support. Rather than locking collections in to a specialised or monolithic repository or database, Arkisto encourages a modular philosophy where the primary object, the data itself, is stored in long-lived formats which are easy to code against, and tools such as indices are relatively cheap to build, deploy and modify.\r\n\r\nI'll present a short explanation of the key standards and concepts behind Arkisto, and show a couple of applications of its use as a data publication repository at UTS, and at PARADISEC, an extensive collection of cultural data around endangered languages.",

Along the way we'll also touch on some of the other security and performance management capabilities that  SELinux and CGroups bring to containerised deployments.\r\n\r\nTo outline the benefits, and some of the bumpy bits along the way, Steve will use his initial deployments of Home Assistant and Mosquitto as containerised services for home automation, alongside workloads currently unsuitable for rootless containers.",

From CCTV cameras on the streets to cookies that track users around the web as they browse, the vast majority of human activity is monitored in some form.  The burden of being watched disproportionately falls on marginalised groups, and people with disabilities are no exception in this regard.  If your medical records contain sensitive information that you've discussed with your doctor to get appropriate treatment, information security suddenly becomes far more important to you.  And if your only method of communication is connected to the Internet 24/7, and thus vulnerable to hackers, true privacy is a great deal harder to achieve.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll examine how data-driven systems view disability, and look at how accessible technology can be exploited to reveal information about its users.  We'll break down ways that disabled people can - and do - avoid tracking and hacking, and find out why paying a 'privacy tax' isn't always feasible for everyone.  Finally, we'll discuss open-source software that's already reducing the impact of surveillance and security risks on people with disabilities, and examine what technologists can do to make the privacy tax less necessary.",

Far from being signs of the apocalypse, these have been the sorts of disasters that Free and Open Source Software conference organisers have faced in the leadup to their events over the last ten years.\r\n\r\nLinux.conf.au in 2011 took place in the immediate aftermath of a one-in-forty year flood on the Brisbane River. North Bay Python in 2019 took place amongst nearby mass evacuations and the threat of smoke pollution from nearby bushfires. PyCon US 2020 cancelled an in-person event and rapidly regrouped to produce online material, barely weeks after Coronavirus became widespread in the United States.\r\n\r\nAll three of these events delivered an event that was significantly different to what they had originally planned, but successfully navigated unexpected circumstances to deliver valuable material and a memorable experience for attendees.\r\n\r\nWhile events like conferences are unique in that people (used to) travel to them, have real deadlines, and have physical constraints that online communities don\u2019t have to deal with, unexpected crises can affect any project.\r\n\r\nThrough interviews with organisers from three disaster-impacted conferences, we\u2019ll explore common themes that helped them successfully navigate a crisis, and important lessons they learned through the process including:\r\n\r\n* Maintaining the trust of your community through effective and timely communication\r\n* Developing and evaluating alternative plans when time is of the essence\r\n* Effectively navigating your commitments with external vendors \r\n\r\nThis talk uses conferences as case studies, but this talk will be of value to anyone who needs to navigate a community-led project through a crisis.

      "abstract": "This talk will take you on our journey from resistance to adoption of something unthinkable - An FPGA company adopting Open Source FPGA Tooling.\r\n\r\nWe are at a tipping point in the semiconductor industry.  Companies are demonstrating that you can build a successful business model based on open source; just look at the accelerating adoption rate that RISC-V ISA is seeing in the processor space.  And yet this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how disruptive open source hardware can become to the semiconductor industry.  \r\n\r\nSince the inception of our industry, the vendor-supported FPGA development tools have been proprietary and closed source. Initially this was simply because that is the way things were done \u2013 there were no open standards. But over time, keeping them closed and proprietary enabled a level of influence and control over users. If a designer liked your software, they tended not to change, and that implicitly makes your user base captive.\r\n\r\nOpen source FPGA tools have been around for a long time, being used primarily by hobbyists and in academia. Over the past few years, this situation has evolved, with an increasing number of new developers with software backgrounds gravitating towards open source FPGA development tools, including design teams at some of the largest companies in the electronics industry.\r\n\r\nSo, why do FPGA companies still resist them? \r\n\r\nNot Invented Here? Fear? Control?\r\n\r\nThis talk will serve two purposes:\r\n1.\tTo show how one company is building its future on top of open source FPGA tools\r\n2.\tTo share how we arrived at our decision in the hope that others will soon take the same leap.",

These resources were designed to align with the WA curriculum, to highlight collection materials and to extend the services that we provide to schools in WA.\r\n\r\nPutting together sites of this nature can be very time consuming from a research perspective, so in many cases we re-used content from pre-existing websites made by previous staff at the State Library of WA. These websites have a wealth of valuable information, but the design and interface was old and unattractive. Rebuilding them on Omeka gave us a chance to update them and provide better metadata, tighter links to our catalogue, include content from Trove and innovative interactive elements such as a timeline. We will talk about the process of building these sites and how we used information and resources provided by others in the GLAM community. We would like to give a view under the hood and show how Omeka is quite friendly even for less technical users and can be used to enhance the online offerings of GLAM organisations of all sizes.",

These are cheap-ish little fan-less single board computers with a 1 GHz AMD GX-412TC 4 core CPU (64-bit, of course), 4GB RAM, 4x Gbit Ethernet ports, and plenty of other connectors and options. I put in a PCIe SSD card.\r\nI first talked to the board's BIOS via a serial cable (was already up-to-date, good), and installed Debian 10 on it (with some minor hackery) from a USB stick.\r\n\r\nAnd behold, my NBN HFC connection is now stable, and faster.\r\n\r\nMaybe you would like to do something similar, or maybe you just want to pick up a few of the things that I've done - you can do any of this with a regular Linux box as well:\r\n - A few of the ports are configured as a switch, using bridged network interfaces.\r\n - One port talks to the NBN HFC modem with PPPoE connection and a VLAN, insisting it's actually the original ISP-provided device.\r\n - IPv4/IPv6 native dual stack, each with subnets (I just have those, from when I ran a company from home)\r\n - Outbound rate-limiting on the HFC connection to keep the stupid NBN happy.\r\n - Appropriate kernel tuning via sysctl - seemingly quite necessary for dealing with funny traffic!\r\n - A hand-crafted effective firewall, providing safety but also (when desired) insights in what fun tries to scan and gain access, how and from where.\r\n - Configuring Unbound DNS to get rid of most ads on the LAN.\r\n - Surviving a reasonably-sized DDoS or other attack without flinching too much.\r\n - Using dynamic geo-blocking, again with options to gain insight.\r\n - WireGuard VPN end-point, both for my own devices and for geo-tunneling (using policy routing) (* see below for a WireGuard love story)\r\n - Optional Suricata intrusion detection/prevention.\r\n - Being invisible for scans, if so desired.\r\nExtra options are adding mobile data backup with an on-board SIM card (may do), and wifi (might do using my 2nd board).\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show what it all looks like on the outside and inside, and go over the configuration - understandable for small league nerds.\r\nSo you can do this yourself, or just learn more about how the various bits work.\r\n(Some entertaining stuff-ups and anecdotes are also included.)\r\n\r\n* A WireGuard love story\r\n\r\nWhat if there was a VPN that only requires a few thousand lines of code, and lives inside the kernel?\r\nHorays! Thanks to Jason Donenfeld, WireGuard is now available in recent Linux kernels, and otherwise easy to add.\r\nBut how to set it all up? The documentation is kinda all there, but mostly if you already know your stuff.\r\nTutorials abound, but some things have changed since. Aargh.\r\n\r\nSo now that the dust has settled, let's look at this from the non-whizz perspective.\r\nHow to peer, or set up a server with clients, or a network tunnel with policy routing.\r\nI'm not the expert, but I've made it work and I can explain what I did.",

      "abstract": "The world is frankly a bit of a mess right now, and doesn't look like sorting out any time soon.  The post-WW-II / post-Cold War-I period of prosperity seems to have come to an end, and the unfortunately predictable result is geo-political turmoil, and the rising popularity of \"strong\" and \"charismatic\" leaders, not disimilarly to 100 years ago in Europe.  But in those 100 years, technology has come a long way, such that oppression by malevolent governments has become much easier to achieve, and much harder to escape, if we rely on off-the-shelf solutions.    In short, the Digital Summer may be drawing to a close, and a Digital Winter looks likely to blow in to many countries.\r\n \r\nBut its not all doom and gloom:  The open-source community offers hope, through its ability to create solutions that are decentralised and self-sufficient.  The Digital Summer is still with us, and so we have time to create effective solutions. We need systems that exhibit \"Digital Sovereignty\".  By this, we mean systems that cannot be subjugated, subverted or supplanted by hostile third-party actors, such as state-level actors.  In short, we need systems that will let people keep on communicating when the proverbial hits the oscillatory.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explain more of these ideas of Digital Sovereignty, the Digital Winter, and how we can work to shorten (or potentially avoid it) and how I am working to create a digitally sovereign smart-phone, as an example of a Digitally Sovereign device.",

Combining this with TensorFlow Lite and GStreamer,\r\nwe get a powerful open source AI stack for video analytics. And because\r\nthe stack is open from top to bottom, we get visibility into the complete\r\ninference process, allowing us to better understand and explain how an \r\nanalytic model makes its predictions.\r\n\r\nThe ability to explain how a model infers it's results (explainability) is an\r\nincreasingly desirable ML feature, particularly in applications that have an impact\r\non privacy, such as video facial recognition. Explainability allows us to build\r\nethical and trustworthy ML systems known to be free from bias. \r\nClosed source blobs and libraries interfere with explainability by hiding\r\ncrucial computations from view. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will walk through the process of building an AI-driven multimedia\r\npipeline on top of a completely open source inference stack:\r\nopen source GPU driver, machine learning framework and machine learning models.\r\nWe will share what we have learned about optimizing these models to run fast\r\non resource-constrained hardware such as the Rockchip RK3399.

Zephyr, a Linux Foundation project, is a real time operating system targetted at computers too small to run Linux.   Zephyr aims to bring the Linux Effect to remote sensing, building automation, industrial control, and more.\r\n\r\nThere've been a number of Zephyr talks at LCA in the past, but I want to focus on the practicalities of developing and testing an IoT solution running Zephyr, with help from Linux.    Many of my projects involve zephyr devices that use Bluetooth, LoRa or 4G NbIoT and aren't directly reachable from the internet for debugging and upgrades.   So when we're in the early stages of field testing a Zephyr device, we send a Linux box along as a Troop Leader to look after the zephyr scouts.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will begin with the practicalities of getting started with Zephyr---picking a board that is easy to use and getting you over the hump of beginning development.    The first few times I tried Zephyr, encouraged by previous LCA speakers, I gave up in frustration, but eventually it \"Clicked\" and I want to share the tips and gotchas I've learned that will save you frustration.   Next, I will cover how I prepare an embedded linux system for remote cellular access in the field (working around Telstra's frustrating use of multiple layers of NAT), and use this linux system to monitor and upgrade zephyr-based sensors during the test phase (SPOILERS: we use SaltStack, ZeroTier and MCUmgr to provision a Raspberry Pi to be a VPN gateway to the Zephyr devices under development).\r\n\r\nAs an example, we'll discuss a feral animal management solution that really does involve a Zephyr device (and sometimes its Linux troop leader) sitting in a tree, observing and photographing animal behaviour.",

In August 2017, amazee.io open-sourced the latest iteration of their hosting platform, Lagoon, and entered a new realm of collaboration with their customers and users.  From his unique perspective and journey from a customer to Product Lead, Toby will present an overview of Lagoon's development over the last three years of growth.  In this talk, he'll uncover what it means to balance open-source with commercial interest, how contributions are a two-way street, and how to form deep, lasting partnerships with your users.  Showing examples where customer and partner collaborations have led development alongside internal developer-driven innovations will hopefully help to illuminate some of the benefits that working in the Open can provide all parties.",

In 2019 we closed our doors, to reshape our Federation Square building in order to become more public-facing, and to house a major new permanent exhibition, The Story of the Moving Image.\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine, we have a lot of moving image to show, and a lot of fascinating objects to tell people about, all of which can be overwhelming to some audiences. That's why we designed and built a system called The Lens. Every visitor to the museum can pick up a Lens, which they use to collect objects and media to watch and explore in their own time. The Lens depends on a network of hundreds of Raspberry Pi devices to display media and interact with visitors, all running Python on Linux. All these devices need to be robust and maintainable in order to survive the 10-year lifespan of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll give you a tour of the technology at ACMI, including our Internet-of-Things fleet and management tools, why Linux has been such a great choice for all of our devices, and XOS, the eXperience Operating System, which provides content and configuration to the devices.",

Together with a bunch of similarly crazy folks, we have succeeded in making a complete community-designed and funded open-hardware computer, including a beautiful mechanical keyboard and injection moulded case. We are of course, talking about the MEGA65 retro computer.  \r\n\r\nThe MEGA65 is a re-creation of the never released Commodore(tm) 65 / 64DX computers, of which numerous prototypes existed. So our goal was to create something that looks just like the original, and that could share the joy of 1980s computing to both new and old audiences.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we discuss how we went about creating the physical form, culminating in a device that even owners of the original Commodore(tm) 65 prototypes agree is better and more polished. This will include how we tackled the design of the case, and getting that translated into working (and paid for!) injection moulds, as well as the full custom mechanical keyboard and its beautiful double-shot top and front printed key caps, and the full custom motherboard, and also how we managed to buy a bunch of 3.5\" floppy drives in 2020 to go in the machines -- all without the stress and burden of running a traditional crowd-funding campaign.\r\n\r\nThe session will be a mix of sharing our path, together with open discussion so that folks who are thinking about making open hardware systems can pick our brains, so that we can help others along their open-hardware journeys.",

FOSS technologists should support and build crossover communities of learners who co-create new practices with software they never thought they\u2019d be able to use, let alone apply in their day to day work.

These instruments actively respond during performances to assist musicians. The tools exist to create these instruments today with single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone.\r\n\r\nWe envision that musical instruments of the future will do more than react to musicians. They will predict their human player\u2019s intentions and sense the current artistic context. Intelligent instruments will shape their sonic output, seamlessly add expression to sounds, or even generate notes that the performer hasn\u2019t played (yet!).\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Charles will discuss recent progress in creating intelligent musical instruments with machine learning. He\u2019ll talk about what intelligent instruments might mean to musicians, to their music-making process, and what new music these tools can create. In particular, he'll introduce the process of developing intelligent musical instruments using the Raspberry Pi platform.",

It's a similar idea to Second Life or to a lesser extent, VR Chat. Vircadia is a fork of the now dead High Fidelity in its original incarnation. A simple way of looking at it the 3D equivalent of Apache.\r\n\r\nWhat it does is providing a 3D environment (with optional VR support) where to socialize, script, make games, hold meetings, or do most anything that could be done in a 3D setting. It was made to be flexible and can serve many purposes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is made in response to the question \"How can open source play a role in creating, helping and adapting to this ongoing change? What new developments in software and coding can we look forward to in 2021 and beyond?\" made in the call for submissions by Linux Conf AU, and we think we have a good answer.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be mostly a high level overview -- who we are, where this all came from, what is it good for and how we think it can be of great help in current times, as well as what are our plans for the future.",

This is a grassroots initiative coordinated by volunteers to draw together people passionate about digital cultural heritage collections and digital humanities research with interests in data, technology and computation and many questions about where/when/what/how/why AI is going to or can be a part of work practice.  \r\n\r\nNew practices e.g., automation, analytics, or augmentation, need different technical expertise, disciplinary knowledge and cultural experience to be brought together.  A little spark of magic flares when creative and technical minds and gentle hearts come together to ask questions, solve problems and reflect together.   \r\n\r\nThe welcome mat is out and the open source community in Australia and New Zealand are invited to join in, share expertise and learn, and work on projects.  Come to this talk to find out what's happening and why you might like to join us.                 \r\n\r\n[1] https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam/home",

This talk aims to give an overview of what Docker can be used for, and some concrete examples on how to use Docker and Swarm to package up and deploy apps. We'll cover Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml files and how they fit together, and, time permitting, how to use Docker BuildX and Docker App to build multi-platform container images, and package collections of containerised services for easy deployment and versioning. Slowly converting apps to work with Docker is a great way to make them automatically more scalable, consistent, and portable. Participants will be able to work with Docker on their local machines, or use Play With Docker via their web browser to follow along.",

      "abstract": "It's estimated that by 2023, there will be 8 billion voice assistants in the world. We find them on our mobile devices. We find them in our cars. We find them embodied into hardware devices, situated on in our living rooms, our kitchens, our bedrooms. Voice user interfaces - using natural spoken language to issue commands to a computing system - have been around for decades, both in reality, and in our imagination. Advances in machine learning and in embedded hardware mean that voice interfaces are experiencing a renaissance - just ask Siri, or Alexa, or OK Google. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, traditional mainstays of open source speech recognition and voice synthesis are in decline. For example, the CMU Sphinx team has moved on to a commercial project. Common Voice and DeepSpeech from Mozilla are no longer being actively supported, and their future (at the time of writing) is unclear. The open source voice assistant community - Mycroft, Julius, Sepia, OVAL - is fragmented, and struggling to gain traction due to the power of content creators  - such as Spotify - to dictate which channels their content can be accessed through. This reinforces the power and the dominance of proprietary players. \r\n\r\nThose same proprietary players are driven by commercial considerations to operate in markets that yield a profit - mostly white, Western markets. Without open source options, much of the Global South will be under-served by voice technology and its benefits - the ability to overcome poor literacy, gain instant access to information without a computer in your own language - and so on. \r\n\r\nIf we're going to use voice technology to provide benefits to some groups of people in the world, and in doing so, that reinforces digital divides around inclusion, equity and access, then shouldn't voice technology be a public good?\r\n\r\nThere are several things we can do to intervene in this state of affairs, including; \r\n\r\n- gaining more widespread support and adoption of open source voice assistants, which aids the case for content providers to support them;\r\n- investing in voice for low resource languages through measures such as corpora creation, and tools for training low resource languages; \r\n- ensuring that we know the value our voice data has for proprietary providers, and choosing judiciously when we share it;\r\n- and allowing more services that have benefit to marginalised groups to deliver their services through voice user interfaces.\r\n\r\nBut there are significant barriers to achieving voice that is more accessible to all, including; \r\n\r\n- the vast amounts of data required for training;\r\n- the high barriers to entry of deep learning and machine learning infrastructure; \r\n- and differences in languages and accents \r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an overview of the landscape, and identify where, and how, we can best intervene to ensure everyone has a voice.",

However, rather than shoehorning it into the existing code used by the TLSv1.2 stack, it was decided that the slower approach of developing a new TLS stack from scratch would be preferable. Over the course of a year or so, three people worked for approximately six weeks to produce a TLS stack consisting of just under 7,000 lines of C code.\r\n\r\nThis talk will look at the design decisions made and approaches taken while implementing a TLS stack from scratch. We'll discuss the challenges of fitting new code into an existing long standing API, along with various problems encountered due to assumptions made in existing open source software, particularly failure modes triggered by changes in API behaviour. Interoperability will be covered, along with approaches to testing complex protocols. We'll also look at some of the pitfalls and implementation complexities that originate from the RFC.",

      "abstract": "Suspend-to-idle is a system-wide suspend variant which in principle does not rely on platform support. The suspend-to-idle control flow does not take non-boot CPUs offline and expects all CPUs to enter idle states through the idle loop, like in the working state of the system. However, it assumes that the scheduler tick will be stopped on all CPUs and the timekeeping will be suspended, which is a source of significant complications. It also expects system wakeup devices selected by user space to be functional and it needs to prevent all of the other interrupt sources from waking up the system. In some cases one interrupt source can signal both wakeup and non-wakeup events, so it is necessary to distinguish the former from the latter. All of that together causes the suspend-to-idle support code in the Linux kernel to be quite complex, especially on systems where ACPI is used, and that code has changed for multiple times in response to additional pieces of information on what is needed coming mostly from the users in the form of problem reports. I will describe the evolution of that code since its inception in 2013 and explain the reasons for making the changes in it.",

And while you are taking stock of your personal life, let me talk you through taking stock of your professional life, or at least the bits of it you have managed to document. In the hustle of the beforetimes, documentation was often a forgotten or sidelined thing that you could do roughly now, fix later, or just never quite get around to. Take a deep breath, look around your home office, give the dog a pat, and let's work out what you have, what you need, and how you can open a can of Marie Kondo on all of it.",

The plaintiff? A prolific filer of patent suits, and a patent assertion entity. This was the first time that a FOSS project has been sued for patent infringement.\r\n\r\nThis talk is the story from the Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, on how he responded and the strategies taken to not only defeat the suit, but to secure a ground-breaking agreement which means that this particular PAE will never be able to sue any FOSS project ever again.",
